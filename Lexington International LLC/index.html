                                    Instances are built on fully redundant architecture designed to eliminate downtime, reduce cost, increase flexibility and optimize performance. All the elements of a cloud solution,n compute, network, storage and security reside at-the-ready, so virtualized systems can be deployed as needed with virtually no downtime.

                                Public clouds can be deployed faster than on-premises infrastructures and with an almost infinitely scalable platform.  Every employee of a company can use the same application from any office or branch using their device of choice as long as they can access the Internet.

                                While security concerns have been raised over public cloud environments, when implemented correctly, the public cloud can be as secure as the most effectively managed private cloud implementation if the provider uses proper security methods.

                                        Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources, that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. This is an excellent choice if you need your 
                                        service across isolation and provider boundaries.    
                                        </p>    
                                    </div>

                            <p>
                                You may store sensitive data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can also use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can’t be met by the private cloud. This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.
